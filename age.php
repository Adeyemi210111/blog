    <h4 id="chap-1">Chapter One</h4>
  <p>What do you mean by you are in love with her? , Guy I don’t think you’re in your right sense. Tunde kept ranting on and on for what felt like hours but I wasn’t even listening, I was lost In thought, how did I even end up this way, how did I end up falling for her, Aunty Tayo; yes, I said Aunty, aunty Tayo was my elder sister’s friend, one that now occupies every inch of my heart, she was 6 years older than I was and just finished with her NYSC, but that didn’t stop the love I developed for her, I just wanted to be there for her, to make her smile, I would fantasize about having her in my arms and staring at her beautiful eyes, yes she was indeed beautiful, age is just a number I would say to myself, but deep down I knew I was just a fool building castles in the air, but I didn’t mind being a fool, I just wanted to be her fool (indeed I was lost). How it all started , how I became this lovestruck, it all started a year ago , when she was in her final year in the University of Lagos ,she was studying law, herself and my sister inclusive, I had just finished my waec , having a long and boring holiday before me I knew it wouldn’t be long before I died of boredom, so to prevent that from happening I set out to pay a visit to my sister in school, thus I set out on my journey for the University of Lagos, a journey that was about to change my life.

“Aunty tope I’m in front of the gate , I don’t know how to get to your department from here”, trying to hide the frustration in my voice as I spoke to my sister on the phone, I was already tired from my wandering about in my effort to locate the school, I had heard alot about the prestigious University of Lagos and the classy students of the school, trying to also blend in my ego prevented me from asking for directions,

I just wanted to be a part of them and indeed I looked like one also ,thanks to my sister who taught me the various ways of combining various designs and shades of cloths to look really as they say it “fresh”,

and I was putting on one of my best cloths that day; my white top with dollar signs and my blue jean and my new all star loafers, I was indeed prepared for my first day in the University environs, and luckily for me , I had this height and look that made me look more matured than I was and this always gave me an edge over my mates.
“Wo, mowa ni class(look, im in class) I can’t come to pick you now”…, I didn’t listen to the rest of what my sister said as I was already angry at her, how would she expect me to stand under the sun here till she finished her class, and I didn’t hesitate to let her know of my displeasure, “ok, I will ask my friend to come and pick you” she said after my ranting, ok I said as I hung up, I was already regretting why I embarked on this journey, after about 30 minutes of standing under the scorching sun and thinking of various ways to express my anger at my sister in a little respectful way. “Are you tunji?” , I heard someone say behind me in a voice that felt like the angels had heard my prayers, as I turned back to place a face behind the sweet voice, the face I saw left me speechless, of course I had heard my sister ramble about how beautiful her friend was but I never took the time to imagine it until now, I just stood there staring like a dumb idiot, until she repeated herself again , “are you tunji? Tope’s brother”, ye…yes I said in my already coaxed voice, I’m tunji. Ok my name is….. I didn’t hear everything else she said as I was already buried in thoughts at how a person can be so beautiful, I didn’t even know what caused my reaction like that, mayb it was because I had not really seen much of beautiful girls in my secondary school not alone spoken to one, but damn she was really beautiful, she had these eyes that said look at me, and when she opened her mouth to speak I couldn’t help but notice her perfect set of teeth, not to talk of the rest of her body that was so perfectly carved, could it be God that made this one also , she looks so…
“Hello, is everything ok? You’re not answering my question and just been staring… I jolted back to reality, as I found out how a fool I must look, what was I thinking….
“Ehhhm , sorry I didn’t hear what you said, my mind wasn’t here” , I managed to say. God she was so beautiful….
.
</p>
  <h4 id="chap-2">Chapter Two</h4>
  <p>Chai, your own crazy is from another level (tunji could barely hide the laughter in his voice) and you’re saying rubbish with confidence, you’re telling me you’re in love with someone old enough to be your aunty, what type of pervert are you?…pervert!! Did he just call me pervert?,

Do I have to be a pervert to fall in love with someone, or is this society so distorted now that falling in love with someone a little bit older than yourself is now considered a perverted action.

This guy is clearly out of his mind, I wonder how he got to be my friend (I said in my mind), clearly I wasn’t just in the mood for tunde’s arguments today, there are more pressing matters on my mind, like how I am going to get aunty Tayo to even pay attention to me , even I know in my mind that I’m going crazy, but this isn’t just anyhow crazy, I’m lovesick, tunji why can’t you just be like every normal person and fall in love with people of your age category? , And now I’m talking to myself , I think I’m going to need a love doctor very soon!!!. Still thinking how I ended up with so much love for aunty Tayo, yeah, that was after she came to pick me up at the gate, that was when….

Hello!!! you’re beginning to creep me out(she said with this look on her face), I jolted back to reality, now I knew in my mind I had messed up, but I managed to summon whatever self esteem I had left, please I’m so sorry, I guess I’m having a not so good day so it’s taking its toll on me, please I’m so sorry(I managed to say , I could feel the bile rising up my throat). It’s okay, she said; just come with me I’m going to be late for class. The journey from unilag gate to faculty of law was the longest journey of my life, as I kept on thinking of various ways to start a conversation but I couldn’t summon the courage to speak out, after much battle in my head I managed to mumble something that sounded like “you’re studying law right?” (That moment I knew I messed up again, that was obvious now, she was my sister’s classmate and my sister was studying law, God!! tunji, what were you thinking?). That moment I was expecting her to say something really sarcastic, but then what she did next swept me off my feet. She looked at me, smiled(with her perfect set of teeth, and her eyes dazzled like the Cupid’s diamond), she smiled and said , yes , I’m a law student and I’m in my final year, are you going to ask for my height and weight also(she said with sarcasm in her voice), but it was the sweetest thing I’ve heard, at that moment I knew I was bought. The smile just seem to melt the pressure between us, because for the rest of the journey, I didn’t know I could crack jokes so we’ll, for she kept on smiling for the rest of the journey, by the time we got to faculty of law, I knew I didn’t want her to leave.
So you’ll have to wait here , let me call your sister for you, she said. This was my moment, I knew I had to make my move now, it’s either now or never, tunji speak, and just as what felt like the ground was about to swallow me , I managed to say ” I really enjoyed talking to you, I don’t know if you could give me your number, you know just to say hi or something, or in case I need your help or something (and I kept on fumbling in a pathetic attempt). It’s okay , I enjoyed your company also, sure you can have my number and make sure you call me, she said with smile as she walked away, I couldn’t help but notice her perfect stature, someone really took the time to shape her piece by piece, she had the perfect curves and hips that looked like my friend would say “hourglass”, I couldn’t help but keep myself from staring at her as she walked away, what a perfect…..
Tunji, I’m sorry for keeping you waiting, I had a meeting after class, my sister’s voice echoed into my imaginations, chai, she just likes to spoil the moment. It’s okay aunty tope, it’s no big deal, can we leave now, I said , I could barely hide the excitement in my voice , I was so happy, I had just made friends with a beauty, I was the luckiest person on Earth at that moment, and for the hundredth time that day, I smiled, for no reason at all, I just knew I needed to smile, and I smiled….

It’s been a week now since the encounter, I hadn’t gotten the courage to call her, Everytime I picked up my phone to call her, I would just find a reason to brush off the thoughts, what if she doesn’t remember me?, What if she was just being nice and she never truly enjoyed my company, what if she gave me a wrong number, what if?.. so many scenarios just kept playing in my head,. Well it was either today or never, it time to gather whatever courage I could muster and make that call, with my heart beating as fast as a racehorse injected with high level of cocaine,I picked my phone and dialed her no
Grrrr grrrr, grrr grrr ( I waited patiently, with my tongue in between my teeth as the phone rang)
Hello!! , Her voice came on,( I could still remember that voice, that sweet tiny voice)
Hello, good evening, I said;
Good evening, sorry who is this?
This is tunji, we met a week ago( I said expecting a tone of familiarity in her voice)
Ehhhm, sorry I can’t remember meeting any tunji.
And bam, that was the last thing I heard as my heart shattered into one million parts, she had forgotten me, just like that, here I was, I could barely lift a hand without thinking of her, and she had completely forgotten about me , so much for I enjoyed your company, life indeed wasn’t fair.

</p>
  <h4 id="chap-3">Chapter Three</h4>
  <p>“I’m tope’s brother, ring a bell now”, I said with little bit of what sounded like disgust or anger or both, I just wanted to end the conversation, I’ve been humiliated enough.

“Oh oh ohhhh, oh my God, tunji ,oh I remember you now, please I’m so so sorry, it totally skipped my mind, I’m deeply sorry”.. she said

Wow, I totally skipped her mind, could this conversation get any worse, I just want to end this conversation already, how will you forget a person, just like that, but then, what was I expecting, we only met just once, I was the fool building castles in the air, and a big fool indeed. So with all comportment, I managed to sound as calm as I could

“It’s totally nothing dear, I’m sure you’ve just been really busy” I said, wishing I really meant that.

“Yeah, been really busy, with my project and stuffs, speaking of busy, I’m really kinda busy now, do you mind calling me back later, tomorrow perhaps, I really am so sorry”. She said as calmly as possible.

“Oh, ok no problem, just wanted to say hi, do have a wonderful night” . I muffled as gently as humanly possible, but boiling deep within. But why did she have to sound so sweet, I almost didn’t mind the whole forgetfulness, her voice sounded so perfect, like the acoustics you hear from the angelic piano. But there was no way I was falling for that again, it was obvious she didn’t need me, what was I even thinking, a beautiful lady in the prestigious University of Lagos, with all those so called fresh guys and their flashy cars, and there’s me, the only thing I had to offer was my sense of humor, And I could barely laugh at my own jokes. I smiled as I deleted her number from my phone, it was the only possible way I was going to get over this craziness. For the last time that day as I laid down to sleep I smiled, not because I was happy that I had lost the one I claimed to love, but because I couldn’t help but notice how good a joker life itself was , I’m sure reality itself would smile as it stared at my pathetic soul, a big sad joke, I thought, as I drifted off in sleep…..

“Tunji!!! please put the drinks in the cooler and add the ice block, and tell mum to hurry up, I don’t want us to be late”, my sister’s voice echoed right through the walls to my room, I smirked as I added finishing touches to combing my hair, I smiled as I stared at myself in the mirror, alot had changed ever since, if not one thing, i could see the tiny strands of hair growing around my moustache, I really felt old. Just need to add my perfume and I would be good to go. Im really looking my best today, I had my favourite jean on, with my well dry-cleaned white shirt, a blazer , newly bought shoe sparkling from adding so much polish and a pair of dark sunshades to match, this was indeed my killer style, had to look my best today, it’s my sister’s convocation ceremony, and I’m Feeling so happy, one would think all the excitement was for my sister’s convocation, but deep within, one Wouldn’t know I had my own motives, a motive I found really weird myself just thinking it. I was going to see her today, she would also be convocating today, I could feel the butterflies leap in my stomach as the thought of seeing her flashed in my mind, a reaction I found weird even to myself. It’s been almost 6 months now since my last encounter with Tayo(the whole aunty stuff ,made her seem pretty old to me and I didn’t like the sound of that), I could still remember the call and her voice as she destroyed my heart that night. One would think I would have gotten over her by now, but that was the weird part, I just couldn’t seem to get my thoughts off her, deleting her number was probably the worst mistake of my life, but then I couldn’t just get her off my mind, and as days passed into weeks and weeks into months, her face kept crawling into every vacant space in my head, I could barely have a night sleep without her finding a way to crawl into my dreams, I was indeed obsessed, but I didn’t seem to mind, this was an example of a necessary evil, she is my necessary evil.

“Segun!!, what are you still doing in the room na!!”, My sister yelled at me.
” I’m coming, I’m almost done”, I yelled back. My sister just knows how to create some sort of rippled effects in my brain with her noice, how she got to be my sister is still a question I’ve been meaning to ask our parent sometime in the future, when I’m more independent.
“Oya , please can we go now, one would think you would have been ready after shouting my name like that”, I said , with this look of anger on my face, but I did well to smile after that so as to avoid her venting her frustration on me, it’s too early for that now, and it was going to be a big day for me, wouldn’t want to give my sister the pleasure of ruining it for me, so it’s best we just did each other the honour of respecting each other.
“Is it not mummy, I don’t know what she is doing in the room lataro(since morning), I want us to hurry up before traffic starts building up”. My sister said , one could almost taste the frustration in her voice.

“Omo mi mabinu(my daughter don’t be angry), it’s all for your own good, don’t you want people to see what a beautiful mother you have” . Mom said with a big smile on her face. Now I know where I got my sense of humor from.
“Sha let’s go”. My sister said.

The journey to Unilag was pretty quiet, except for some few occasional remarks from our parent. Mom had wanted to bring along, couple of her friends, but my sister had refused blatantly, claiming she didn’t want too much people present.

“Tope, you should have allowed mummy Femi to come with us, at least to celebrate with you” . My mum said.

“Mummy I already told you, I don’t want too much people, you’re even lucky I let you and Dad even come along, left to me, I would rather just go on my own”. My sister said not feeling excited about the conversation.

“You’re joking, on my own daughters convocation, I will not now be present, olorun onije (God forbids it). Mum said, already feeling agitated.

“Iya tunji, please leave the girl alone, let her do whatever pleases her, shez not a baby anymore”. My dad spoke for the first time that day.
But I was barely interested in the conversation, I just kept mute all through the journey, what was on my mind, was very important, I had to see aunty Tayo, been a really long time. I just could not wait to get to unilag, and we did get there.

“Tunji ,please take the cooler underneath that tent, my friend should be there also and please tell her to come. Aunty tope said. But I didn’t hear the rest, did she just say friend, oh God, how was I supposed to face her friend, and this just turned to be the scariest movie ever, how was I supposed to look her in the eye and talk , I knew life just wasn’t done making jokes of me yet, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse.
I summoned every courage I could muster, picked up the cooler and started walking towards the tent, in what felt like forever. rehearsing my lines properly, I knew I couldnt afford to flop the second time, this was another chance being handed to me, I musnt ruin it.
And that was when I saw her….
I never expected the sight I saw, fine , I had created various possibilities in my head , the previous day and toyed with various imaginations in my head, but I never expected the sight that greeted me , my mouth dropped open while I made little or no effort to close it back.
She was putting on a black gown, with silver linings, the neck was done in such creative way that her perfectly sculptured body was like an illusion, she had silver pair of heels on, her hair was long and flowing and seemed to bounce with each stride she took, and her eyes were enough to melt every anger that was left in me. She looked up, I’m sure she could see me now, as she smiled, revealing the perfect set of teeth. A smile was already forming on my face when I saw the most heartbreaking thing of my life, waking hand in hand with her, was a guy, an unknown face, she held him so cordially it was obvious he was not just any regular guy. He bent to whisper something in her ear, and she giggled.
She giggled and I don’t know why, but for the first time I felt this tinge of jealousy and anger at the same time, I felt angry at the guy, why did he have to make her smile, why did he have to be so handsome, and well composed also, there’s no way I’m competing with that. They were headed towards me now, they seemed like the perfect match.
I just felt like the ground would open and save me from this uncomfortable situation. I was burning inside, a fire fueled by my anger.

“Hello tunji, nice to see you again”, she said in the same sweet voice. The same sweet voice that I could remember, same sweet voice that echoed continually in my dream. And for a moment there , I had forgotten about the guy standing next to her, I was just lost in the Paradise I had built for myself.

And then he spoke……

</p>
 <h4 id="chap-4">Chapter Four</h4>
  <p>I don’t know which is more annoying, the fact that the guy is just smiling like a proud father whose son just built him a house, or the fact that he had his hands around her, I just want to kick his hands off her, I feel really angry.
“Hi Tayo” I said , trying to hide the displeasure in my voice. “Congratulations,on your convocation, you look really lovely”.

“Awwn, thanks tunji, you don’t look bad yourself”. She said, as she flashed her set of white teeth at me again, if only she knew what that smile was doing to me.

“And by the way, tunji, meet my brother Tofunmi, tofunmi, Tunji; tope’s brother”. She said as she introduced the guy to me.

” What’s up bro?, Nice to meet you” he said calmly as he offered his hand for a shake.

“Pleasure is mine boss”, I said , as a wave of relief hit me, how come I didn’t realize that before, of course I was too busy being jealous, I should have noticed the resemblance, he had that perfect smile too, maybe the eyes were different but then if one paid proper attention, the similarities were there. I sighed, at least no immediate threat for now. I smiled in my mind.

The rest of the day went pretty fast, I barely had any encounter with Tayo or her brother anymore that day, as they were busy serving guests and taking pictures with family, and I was also doing the same with my sister, though our tent was right beside theirs, I didn’t think it was cool for me to intrude in her space before she starts thinking me weird, it is their convocation after all, I should just get her off my mind for today and focus on having fun, there’s always tomorrow I said to myself, but occasionally I would steal glances at her and admire her from far, I really think I’m beginning to take things too far, but then how far is far enough?….

The sun was shining brighter now, and it was already beginning to feel like a thousand ovens were opened in my stomach, I was already sweating profusely, my sister wasn’t making matters easy for me , just when I would think I had nothing else to do, she would just pop up again, sending me to get something, either get the drinks from the car or give food to someone, I was already beginning to get irritated. As I dropped the pack of drinks, I saw my food lying all alone on the table ,beckoning on me , I knew this was my chance to eat before I lost my appetite, without thinking twice and allow someone else to call me again to get something, I dashed for the food and started munching like a rabbit unfed for many days, I went for the meat next (or as I like to call it drumstick) and nibbled on that too, I never knew food could taste so delicious…

“Hmmmm, look who didn’t invite me to eat”, I looked up immediately as I saw her staring at me, I felt really embarrassed, how long had she been staring, I hope she didn’t see me cracking the bones or sulking the calcium out of the bone. I really should be ashamed of myself.

“And I thought we were friends”, she said , this time with sarcasm in her voice.

“We are friends now, please don’t mind me, you can still come and join me, I’m sure there’s still bone left “, I managed to say,

“No jor, finish your food and let’s take pictures together, won’t be nice if we didn’t take any pictures together”. she said.

“Let’s just take it now”, I said, as I stood up to clean my hands and drink water. “Before you get busy again”, I said, this time smiling.
She smiled also as she reached for her phone to take the pictures, and just then my mum thought it was the perfect time to interrupt.

“Tunji, please take this drink to the car now, let’s start packing up, your dad has a meeting” my mum said, ignorant of the perfect moment she had just ruined.

“But mum, I’m trying to ….”
“It’s okay tunji, I also need to go help my mum pack, I’m sure there will always be another day for our pictures” Tayo said, as she walked away, I couldn’t help but stare at her again this time around as I grudgingly picked up the drinks, could today get any worse.

The week after the convocation, was one of the best weeks for me, every night, I would have a lengthy chat with Tayo, we got to talk about so many things, she told me all about herself ,and I did likewise also, I would crack all kinds of jokes just to make her smile, and whenever she did, I would feel this satisfaction like I had just achieved my dreams. Thus it went on and on, day after day, to the point I was always looking forward to her coming online, it was like we had developed this bond already and I was liking every moment of it.
I waited patiently online today, the time was almost 8pm, I knew she would come online soon, but I feel nervous today, I’ve been thinking about asking her to go see a movie with me, but then I don’t know how she would see it, I didn’t want her to see it like I was asking her out and probably say no, that would be enough humiliation for me. Or what if she insults me or probably stop talking to me again. I kept on fighting this battle in my mind, tunji be a man, just ask her, it’s only a movie, what could possibly go wrong?

“Tunji mi, bawoni”(my tunji, how are you), she said , as was her custom way of greeting me whenever she came online, and I kind of liked it.
“Good evening dear, how was your day?”, I typed then put a smiley face, I don’t want her thinking I’m too serious. This was a soft ground and I needed to tread carefully. The chat went on for another 30 minutes, just saying random things and dropping jokes, and then I felt it was time to pop the question.

“So Tayo, what’s your plan tomorrow?”, I asked

“Well nothing much , just probably sleep throughout the day, still waiting for NYSC to release the batch list”, she replied.

“Well, I was just thinking if you don’t mind, we could go see a movie together tomorrow, that’s if it’s okay with you”, I replied putting a smiley face again, just in case things went South, I could just easily say it was a joke, I was really nervous.

“Wow, really”, she replied. I dont know if it was happiness or sarcasm. Tread softly tunji, the voices in my head seemed to caution me again, this time they sound louder.

“Yes, you know as friends, just hanging out”, I replied, with my heart almost coming out of my mouth.

“That’s great, tunji you’re a darling, where? And when?”, She said. Was that excitement I could sense in the reply, hmmm, tonight is already turning too good.

“Let meet at ozone, by 3pm, that’s cool with you right?”, I asked .

“Yes, it’s perfect” she said

“Nice, it’s a date” I replied
“Not date like date date, but date like date as in date”, God what was I saying, I mustn’t ruin this, I hope she didn’t notice the nervousness in that statement.

“Don’t worry tunji, I’ll be there,”.. she said
I heaved a sigh of relief, that was close, why can’t you just be a man for once, I laughed at myself, if only I could see how pathetic I looked, love indeed could turn anyman into a fool, and I have been foolish for a long time now, I smiled, not at anything but at myself. Could barely wait for tomorrow….

At exactly 2:55pm, I was already at ozone, waiting patiently for her, with so many thoughts running through my mind, what if she doesn’t turn up, well I wouldn’t blame her if she didn’t, why else would she want to hangout with me, what was I thinking, this so called movie was a mistake after all, I should have just respected myself and stayed within the friend zone I was before instead of trying frantically to escape. The time was 3:15, i was already expecting the call where she would say she wouldn’t be coming anymore, so I can just humbly go back to my house with whatever was left of my dignity.
At exactly 3:16, I saw a silhouette of what looked like her alighting from a Maruwa(trycycle), I couldn’t believe my luck, damn she turned up, the day might not end so bad after all, I smiled as I went to meet her…

“Tunji, thank you so much for today, I had a pretty nice time,and the movie was on point” she said, her face beaming with all sincerity.

“You don’t need to thank me jor, I should be the one thanking you, the pleasure is all mine, thank you for accepting the date” I said, this time I knew I could not hide the excitement in my voice, I was damn happy, not because I was actually happy, but because she was happy made me really happy. I really I’m getting so weird.
We talked and laughed some more, then walked together to the gate, it was like an extract from tales from moonlight, everything just seemed so perfect, I was really nailing this. Finally we got to the gate, this was the part where we go out separate ways. She hailed a trycycle to stop, then She stopped to look at me.
“Thank you one more time for today, really looking forward to another time like this” she said.
“The pleasure is all mine dear”, I said as I stated at her sparkling eyes, at that point I knew I had to say something, there was something I wasn’t saying, there was this battle in my mind, my sane part was whispering slowly in my ear to gently humble myself and walk away, while the other part was chanting like saint obi during a ritual process, say it ,say it, say it, it was a real fierce battle, and before I could even think or stop myself, the words came exploding out of my mouth faster than my brains could process it

“I think I’m in love with you”….and bam the words spilled out. It felt like a thousand Piper’s were playing in my head, that instant I felt really dizzy, the whole world was spinning at an accelerating speed in my head, and then everything went black.

</p>
     <h4 id="chap-5">Chapter Five</h4>
  <p>She waved and she was gone before I even had the chance to reflect on what I said, I don’t think she heard what I said, I was so busy with trying to get the word out I completely didn’t notice when she entered the napep(trycycle). Some part of me experienced this sort of relief, thank God she didn’t hear, and another part really wished she did, it was really eating me up inside and sooner or later had to let it out. Or could she have heard and pretended, guess I’ll have to ask her tonight when she comes online, so I messed up again. Tunji, be a man, and I think at this point even I I’m tired of hearing that statement, I can be anything, but a man clearly ain’t one of them.

“Hi tunji, thanks for today, really had fun” her message blipped on my phone, I was somewhere between anxious and scared, well what’s the worst that could happen, I said to myself as I replied the chat.

“Good evening Tayo, the pleasure is all mine”, I replied casually.

And then we spoke randomly for a couple of minutes, but she never mentioned anything about what I said, guess this means she didn’t hear me, relief flooded my veins instantly, finally I can breathe. Love could be beautiful, but it’s difficult indeed. Especially loving someone with that much age difference, it’s a burden, it’s like a lady craving ice cream in her period, satisfying but painful, so close but yet so far. If only……

The next month that followed, got really intense, the bond seemed to be deepening with each moment that passed , we would talk for hours on phone, later we started hanging out alot, most times we would meet inside school, faculty of law, sometimes love garden, even relaxation garden at access bank, often times we would go see a movie, I was really living a dream, it felt like everything was really perfect, if this was a dream , let me sleep forever, I never want to awake from this perfect dream. What was left now was for me to tell her about my feelings, we were pretty close now, I don’t think she would do anything really hurtful now, if there was any perfect time it was now, I just had to devise the perfect plan and scenario to tell her. We had a plan to meet the next day, I promised myself in my heart as I slept that night, tomorrow I’m going to tell her, and this time I’m going to do it right. I spent half the night doing rehearsal, it just had to be perfect, one mistake and I could be shattered for life. Look before you leap, and I intend to do just that.

“Tayo, from the first day I met you, I knew there was a connection between us, I know you might think the age difference is much, but love really has no barrier”.

no that was lame, how could I say connection, that sounded like something in one of those Nigerian movies I hated so much. Okay let me try again

“Tayo, you’ve been the happiness in my life, the sunshine in my dark world…

No no no, that sounds too poetic, she might think I’m not serious about it, I just need to come up with something special, something wow.

Thus, I had been practicing on how I was going to ask her out, and making little or no progress, this was more difficult than I thought. After much fruitless attempt, I knew it was only a matter of time before I made a complete fool of myself. The time was 2pm already, she should have been here by now already, please don’t let all this rehearsal be a waste, I muttered under my breath as i dialled her number

“Tayo, what’s up?, I’m already inside school, I’m at the Senate building, where are you?”, I said as she picked the call, we had agreed to meet inside University of Lagos to just hang out that day and I had gotten there almost an hour before the agreed time, I was really eager to just drop what was in my mind, the level of anxiety I was on didn’t let me wanna delay at home for even one minute, so much fuss over this thing called Love.

“I’m still at home, thought we agreed 3pm”. She said.
“Yes, I just called to be sure you didn’t forget” I said.

But truthfully in my excitement I had forgotten we agreed 3pm, I had my mind on 2pm, now I had an extra hour to do what?
The thought of having to stay an extra hour here was killing, well looking at the bright side, I had enough time to practice my proposal, it was a delicate matter. In a couple of minutes I was either going to be the happiest man on Earth, or single to stupour and no friend. I quickly erased the thought from my head, as I went through my lines again….

“Sup tunji, don’t tell me you’ve been here since that time you called me” , she said as she sat down.

“Don’t mind me jawe, I miscalculated, how are you doing” I said as I stood up to hug her

“I’m okay, just tired” she said

And then I asked about her day, how she was doing and some other random things, trying to lay the atmosphere for my plan. And now it was time….

“Tayo, there’s something I need to say to you” I said ,

“Eh eh, what’s that” she asked

“Ehhhm, I just wanted to ask… ” my voice trailed of, I’m really finding things difficult here, come on tunji, just as you practiced

“I just wanted to ask….

…….

Alot was said that day, but not what needed to be said, I never developed the courage to, I knew there and then I had lost my chance forever. The reason I found it difficult till now to disclose my true feelings and intentions to her is still a mystery I haven’t been able to resolve yet. I knew each of this wormhole i found myself now could be traced to the huge gap in the age between us, and Im definitely never going to mention any word about how I really feel to her or anyone, this was my own cross.

Been months now since she’s gone for her NYSC, things have not been the same between us, yeah we still talk occasionally, but the bond was gradually weakening. I still loved her like hell, and couldn’t help but keep thinking about her, but she , she stopped coming online frequently as before, the calls started getting shorter, I guess one could pin that on the rigorousity of the NYSC camp.
Ever since I missed my chance that day, I never really forgave myself for that, the avenue was set, the conversation tilted towards that area, and all I just had to do was tell her I love her, was to open my mouth and say the word, but I was never able to say anything, and that was my greatest mistake.

Thus as she left for camp that day, and waved me bye, I knew there and then I had lost her, not as a friend, but as the love I was never going to have. My Paradise was complete now, but only me is left to wander the empty corridors, the shallow rooms and the void compartments. Who else but a fool to live in a fools Paradise, a Paradise I built for myself.

Love was a myth to me, a story from a far distance, never felt it, never believe it existed, it was a dead man’s tale, and dead men tell no tales, at least not until she came along, she turned my world upside down and left me hanging. She remains my first love and always will be.

Now and then I thought age never meant a thing, age was just a facade designed by the society to keep younger ones from going beyond the environmental bracket. But life indeed had a way of teaching its own lessons, and it’s taught me the hard way,
Age is beyond just a number, age is a determining factor, an endogenous variable in the equation of love, especially in this part of the world we live, to some it counts, and to some it doesn’t, guess I found out too late.
Look before you leap, and if eventually you do fall, make sure it’s for the right person and if it’s for the wrong person, better be sure as hell it’s worth it.
I repeat!!
Age is not just a number

This is my story…….

The End
