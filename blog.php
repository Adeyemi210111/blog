            <p>Dear fellow introverts<br>

Introvert was the least of what they call us, we are what they never understood, guess that’s what scares them, well they should be, if only they knew what was going on in the “introvert’s head”.
We all possess the same traits, the uniqueness, the creativity, the out of the box imagination, and the most glaring of it all is that longing for solitude, for that quietness. </p>

            <p>So I thought I’ll write something for him, looking at it he deserves my all. Growing up, looking at all I’ve been through, how he has been there, and how I would just stare at the sky at night, trying to figure out how one person could just be up there, knowing it all, doing it all , and just loving unconditionally, doesn’t he feel so alone or lonely? </p>

Just when I thought I was already asleep, the music stopped, I felt so irritated, this was the wrong time for my phone to go off, could today get any worse, I sighed out of frustration as I reluctantly pulled the ear buds out of my ear, slowly I got out of bed as I made my way to the light switch, I flicked it on but then nothing happened.<a href="bloodstone.php">continue reading</a></p>
