 <!-- Chapter One -->
    <h4 id="Prologue">Prologue</h4>
  <p>The music was very slow and soothing, just what I needed right now, I could feel my muscles relaxing, after the days stress, it felt like life was being slowly squeezed out of me, I had my earpiece on listening to my collection of enya, the perfect song for the soul, my mind was slowly drifting off into the abyss, and my eyes were finally closing, this one moment sleep felt so peaceful.

Just when I thought I was already asleep, the music stopped, I felt so irritated, this was the wrong time for my phone to go off, could today get any worse, I sighed out of frustration as I reluctantly pulled the ear buds out of my ear, slowly I got out of bed as I made my way to the light switch, I flicked it on but then nothing happened.
"Oh great, no light ", today is already beginning to piss me off already. I looked up where the clock was hung to check the time, even the time had stopped working, that was when I felt the first wave of fear, something felt really off, I reached for my lamp by the bed and tried turning it on, and just as I guessed it wouldn't turn on also, this was more than just a coincidence. I had seen this scene once in an horror movie, where the lights all went off and then a ghost appeared, but then there are no such things as ghosts, even if there was, no couldn't be any ghost in Nigeria, all we have here are witches and wizards and even that idea seemed too far fetched for me. This was all just a big coincidence, moreover, mum and dad are just in the next room, I could scream if anything ghostly tried to appear, I quickly shook the thoughts off as I made my way back to bed, but then something caught my eyes, my phone that I previously left on the bed was now lying on the floor, okay this is getting way out of hand, I was sure I left that phone on the bed, then I felt this tinge at the back of my neck like I was being watched, I quickly scanned the room but it was empty except for myself there was no one else in the room well at least as far as my eyes could see in the dark . But the feeling was still there, I looked at the door and quickly calculated how long it would take me to get to it if I do need to run. I check the room for anything I could use as a weapon, but there was none, I had my lamp on the bed, that wouldn't do any damage, there was the broom, couple of books on the reading table, in short I had nothing that would really do much damage if anybody was to attack, so my best bet was to run for it. As I adjusted myself to make my run, my eyes caught another movement In the room, but this person or whoever it was moved so fast I could barely see a thing , now this doesn't feel so right, I could feel it behind me now, I slowly turned my head but then it was too late as I felt a sharp pain on the back of my head like someone or something had hit me with a big iron pipe, I fell instantly, the whole world felt like it was going round in a big whirl, I tried envisioning who or what had hit me, but then my brain just couldn't seem to make any sense anymore, my eyes closed slowly, and then everything went black.
</p>
  <!-- Chapter two -->
    <h4 id="chap-1">Chapter One (The Chosen One)</h4>
  <p>I woke up feeling weaker than normal, almost felt like I hadn't slept for weeks, my eyes felt heavy and my neck like my head was already too much weight for it to carry, I glanced at my clock, the time was just 7am, how many hours did I sleep?, Weird thing is I can't even remember when I slept. Sighs, I must have been so tired yesterday. I had this feeling like I needed to remember something but then it just wasn't coming, it was a weird sensation, but then Its probably due to my tiredness, it will pass soon I guess, I just need to lay my head down for a little bit, just then my mum's voice echoed into my room.

"Richard, wake up, today is Saturday, you have a lot of chores to do"  she said, her voice echoed in my head. 
I still can't seem to figure out how she always manages to ruin my sleep every weekend, this holiday was really messing things up for me, really wished I was in my hostel now, would have slept till whenever I felt like. I sighed one last time as I made my way out of the room, this was going to be a long day.

"Good morning ma," I said, trying to sound as cheerful as I could.

"How are you doing?, Hope you slept well?" She asked

"I'm fine ma", I replied, feeling less impressed.

"Good, please go wash your clothes off the washing machine, I want to wash", she said

"Okay", I said as I dragged myself , trying to look less worse than I felt. I just wish I could just soak myself in a really cold and chilly water all day with just music, but then, life just ain't fair .

The machine started making the normal whirring sound as I turned it on, Im just not in the mood for anything today, I usually have grumpy attitude whenever I don't sleep well, but this just felt different, like something just wasn't right, but then I couldn't seem to place it. 
The machine had stopped now, I slowly removed the clothes as I headed outside to dry them.

"Mum, I'm done ", I shouted as i made my way out of the house.

The rest of the day went quite fast, I was just slurpy and gloomy around the house, and then the day seemed to be moving so slow, I checked the time and it was just 4pm, I sighed, what a day. Being an only child was really a drag, no one to talk to , my dad just didn't seem like the type of person to relate with on a more personal level, and my mum just wouldn't understand.

"Mum, I want to go pay my friend a visit", I said, hoping I would be able to at least feel alot better with my friend.

"Okay, don't be late" , she replied, she probably wouldn't have noticed I wasn't in the house anyways.

I plugged my ears with my earpiece and turned on my favorite Jon Bellion music as I headed towards my friend's house. <br><br>
                            

                             ……………. <br><br>

It's been 4hours now since I left for my friends house, I slowly made my way towards my house, feeling worse than I felt in the evening, let's just say my friend wasn't as cheerful as I thought. I took a glance at my watch, the time was exactly 8pm, that's strange, I left my friend's house 8pm, this watch stopped again, I sighed as I pulled my phone out of my pocket to check the time, the time was 8pm also on my phone, it was like time had stopped….

Suddenly it felt like I was in a dream, as the memories rushed back in my head, the dark room, the phone going off, someone hitting something on my head, the blackout. Fear gripped me as I remembered everything, one part it felt like a dream , another time it felt so real. I reached for the back of my neck to see if it was swollen or if there was any sign showing that I was hit or something, but then I stopped dead in my track, my hands froze, I couldn't feel my legs, right in front of me was an animal like figure, it had the strangest shape, it's eyes were blue and scary, it had the longest fangs I'd ever seen, it was moving on all fours and it was moving towards me.

I knew I had to do something, I knew my best chance was to run, but then I just couldn't get myself to run, it felt like my body had been disengaged from my brain and I no longer had control, the creature was moving towards me faster now, snarling it's teeth as it approached.

This can't be how it ends, I haven't even achieved my dreams, I still wanted to finish school, get a good job, get married, have cute kids and live in a mansion, I can't just die now, especially not like this.

The creature had stopped right in front of me now, it's eyes boring into my soul, all I could see in it eyes was death, i could see the creature more clearly now, it was actually bigger than I thought, about inches almost as tall as I was despite being on all fours. From it's position I knew it was getting ready to lunge at me, so this is really the end. I closed my eyes as I braced for impact.

"Run", a voice said behind me, as she pulled me out of the way and went straight towards the creature.
She drew a sword out from God knows where and plunged it right into the heart of the creature, it scream echoed right into the night as it made efforts to dig it's nails into her. 
All those while , I just stood there fixed to a spot, I'd never seen anyone that fast, she moved with such speed and agility, I could only imagine such in the movies, I just stood there mesmerized.
As she dug her sword one last time into the creature,. It made a loud growl as it vanished into thin air. She sheathed her sword back and she turned to face me.

"Your highness, my name is treasure, I'm going to be your protector, sorry for hitting you on the head the other night, I just had to be sure you were the one" , she said as she went on her knees.

I fainted…..
</p>
  <h4 id="chap-2">Chapter Two (Chamber of Secrets)</h4>
  <p>Treasure
I am not sure how the elders are going to react to this, he doesn't seem like the typical prince material. That timid and weak human can't be the chosen one, but then the prophesy was clear about it, or could it have been a mistake, how is that supposed to be the one to wield the sacred stone. The elders will definitely be disappointed, I murmured to myself as I made my way to the chamber of secrets where the elders were awaiting the result of the search for the one that would lead us to the stone.

The chamber was located in the inner part of the building, an underground chamber, surrounded by layers of thick walls and a giant door to prevent words ever going out of the room, it was called the chamber of secrets for that very purpose, this was where very important matters were discussed by the elders and important and deadly decisions have been taken in this room, the chamber of secrets.

The elders are known to be the first of the druids, the original druids, the bringer of magic, they were the first to ever practice magic or so it was believed, they are greatly feared in the whole of the druid kingdom, and no one dared disobey a direct order by the council of elders, such disobedience could only mean one thing, death.

The druid kingdom was divided into various sub groups and each wore different coloured robes, the eldest ones or the ones thought to be the wisest was the arch-druid and they always wore a gold robe(the council of elders constituted of various arch druids from all over the kingdom), the ordinary druids would wear white and act as priests, the sacrificers would fight and wear red, they were the warriors, trained in the act of combat and highest form of magic and conjuring, they were sworn to protecting the druid kingdom, this was the category I belong, there are also the blue bards, they are the artistic ones and usually the ones in charge of all the druids writings and paintings. All aspects of druidism were well structured and ordered, from the hierarchy of the druid class to their pattern of life.

As I stood by the door, I felt this reluctance to open the door, what if I had failed in my mission, what if that wasn't the chosen one, what if?, I just can't afford to make any mistake now , that stone is the last hope of the druids , our only chance of survival, I can't just afford any mistake now. I heaved a heavy sigh as I pushed the door open, he just has to be the chosen one or this could just be the end for us.

The chamber looked bigger than I could remember, the seven candles signifying each of the seven elders still stood at the center of the table, the sacred sword of the wailing queens still stood at the edge of the room, many years ago when the druids still controlled the seven kingdoms, the sword was believed to contain the souls of all the queens who ever lived. But now with each day that passes, we can feel the magic slowly being drained out of the air, we could sense it now in our minds, magic was leaving and this time it was leaving for good.

"Who dares enter the chamber of secrets" the first elder asked as his voice echoed around the chamber.

"It is only I, ancient ones" I replied as I went on my knees as was the custom, the elders were meant to be revered, no questions asked.

"Rise, young warlock" the third elder said, I could feel the weakness in his voice, the elders were losing their magic too, making them age faster than normal, and they were ageing pretty fast.

"Thank you ancient one", I replied, rising to my feet.

"Where is the chosen one, or the so called chosen one", the third elder spoke again, this time I could feel the doubt in his voice, alot had changed, the seven elders used to be the protectors of the kingdom, fierce and extremely strong, they were no match for anyone. But now they sit there, looking all old and weak, a pitiful sight. The magic needs to return and fast, the bloodstone must be found, now we left with no choice but to rely on the timid chosen one to lead us to it .

"He sleeps old one, he was pretty shaken from the encounter with the chimera" I said.

My eyes wandered about the chamber again, this time not really knowing what I was looking for , or maybe I just wanted to get my mind off the worries of magic for a while.
I took a quick look at the each of the elders, the first one had a pretty shining head, his eyes pretty sunken also like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders, I tried imagining him to be younger, but I just couldn't seem to picture it.
The second one seemed pretty less scarier, but had almost the same features with the first, except for his missing tooth which made him look quite funny rather than scary. The rest didn't have any distinctive features, just some old looking druids who once had power to the seven kingdoms.

"What do you think of him", the funny looking one spoke this time.

"I think nothing wise one, he looks timid and weak, but he is the chosen one after all", I replied, trying to hide the doubt in my voice

"How can we be sure ,he is truly the chosen one, and not just a random human", the elder at the end of the table asked quite wearily.

"He is meant to have the gift", the oldest of them replied.

"No human has ever been known to ever possess the ability to use magic , not even the simplest of spells" , I replied quite worried.

"True, no human can possess true magical powers, but then the chosen one is not totally human", the older one replied again

"But , how are we supposed to know if he is truly the chosen one" , I asked inquisitively.

"He is going to have to go through the ancient gilbores test of clemency", he replied

"What does that mean", I asked.

"Means , he will have to perform the spell of the wailing monkeys", the last elder spoke now

"The spell of the wailing monkeys!!, I thought that was an ancient spell that could only be cast by the most powerful of druids, the original ancestors, moreover it is known to be a myth, as no one has actually ever seen the spell being performed" I said.

"Yes, it is a powerful spell, it was casted only once , and that was by figol, the first druid Lord, and the most powerful. And since then it was known to be done only by the descendants of powerful bloodlines. But then the chosen one is a mixture of two powerful bloodlines, figol and Blake. So he should be able to perform the spell without complications", the arch druid replied.

"And what happens if he fails", I asked

Like they all had the same mind, they chorused the response at once

"Kill him".

  <h4 id="chap-3">Chapter Three (Wistman's Wood)</h4>
  <p>I woke up to an entirely strange environment, did my mum redecorate my room without my permission?, My eyes seemed pretty heavy and keeping it open seemed like a pretty difficult task. Where was i?, Then the memories of the previous night came flooding into my head, It seemed like a dream at first but then why does it feel so real.
What was that animal that attacked me? Who was the fast lady? Where am I?

"Her name is treasure, she's the captain of the druid warriors (the sacrificers), and you're in wistman's wood Dartmoor" a little girl replied me from the other side of the room,

my heart jumped, how the hell did she know what I was thinking, was this some sort of sick prank or what?

"Yes, I can read your mind" she answered strangely again,

"It's an ancestral type of spell, that is passed down from one generation to the other, this type of spell can not be learnt, it can only be Inherited, my family possesses this enchantment", she explained further

What the hell was she saying?, Spell!, Magic!, Enchantment!, All this were all just stuffs I watched in a basic Harry Potter movie, there was no such thing as magic, someone must really be playing a prank on me here...

"Magic exists, and no one is playing a prank" she replied to my thought again.

"Okay, now that is really creepy, if you keep doing that, I might have to scream pretty soon, I'm already going crazy" I replied, half shouting, I'm sure she could feel the frustration in my voice.

"Forgive me your highness, did not mean to upset you" she said quite soberly.

"I am not your highness, neither do I know who the hell you people are", I replied, already getting angry now

"But, you are... " She was cut short by another voice by the door

"That's enough Arla, you can go", she said. The same lady that had rescued me the previous night , she looks taller than she was the previous night, of probably because I didn't even have the chance to look at her, at least not when I was almost  killed by a deadly and strange animal.

"As you wish Mage", Arla said as she picked up the bowl and left the room.

The lady strode into the room now , I could see her clearly now, she  had this strikingly distinguishing features, she was pretty tall, not the scary type of tall but rather sexy, her eyes had this glow that made it difficult to determine its exact color, one moment it seemed like blue, another moment it's looking brownish.

She was putting on leather jackets and leather pants and boots,all black, she had a sword strapped to her waist, I could see a knife protruding out her jacket, in short she was looking like a character in the matrix movie.

"So are you going to speak, or do I speak first", she asked, she must have noticed me staring.

"Who are you?", I asked , I was already pretty angry , who was she to kidnap me, or control me

"My name is treasure, we met yesterday already, I'm a Mage, the leader of the sacrificers, warriors of the druid kingdom", she replied, ignoring the anger in my voice.

"Who are the druids?, What does sacrificers mean?, Are you going to sacrifice me?, Where am I? How did I get here?.....

"I know you have alot of questions, and I can understand, but you need to calm down and rest a little, I'm sure the will be plenty of time to answer all your questions", she replied this time with a smile

"No, i want answers now, you can start by answering my questions first", I answered, pretty scared now. This stuff was beginning to get real and it was already beginning to piss me off.

"Okay, I might be able to answer a few of your questions, but would you at least have your seat first", she said

"Okay,", I said, as I made my way to the couch close to the bed, the room was properly lit now, and I could see better now, the bed where I laid before ,was quite big and spacious, a king sized bed, the mattress looked quite appealing, covered in silk looking glamorous and luxuriant to the touch, on a more different circumstance,I would have loved to just lay on that bed all day, but then, this was a more serious matter.
I took my seat on the couch, expecting her to take a sit also,but surprisingly she just stood a few meters opposite me.

"Why are you not sitting" I asked

"I'm a warrior, I was trained in the toughest of ways, taught to endure high form of pain. Warriors are not meant to relax, we should always be on guard", she replied, with all seriousness on her face.

"Okay, I get your point", I said, feeling less impressed.

"So where do I start answering your questions from" she asked

"Start by telling me where I am and how I got here, last thing I remember was being attacked by an unknown animal on my way from my friends place " I said

"Okay, you're in one of many druid kingdoms called Wistman's wood, in dartmoor, a vast moorland in the country of Devon, Southwest England"

Did she just say England!!!, How the hell did I get to England from Nigeria in one night, I don't even have a passport. Something is definitely not right here, I think I'm going to go crazy very soon.

"Do you mean, England, like England England", I asked, deliberately repeating the word twice to emphasize my point.

"Yes, and I'm sure you'll be wondering how you're in England so fast, well before I explain that to you, I'll need you to relax and think back,

every story you've been told about demons and magic and how none of those exists is a lie, they all exist, magic and demons and goblins,elves, etc.....they are all true.... The world as you know it is about to change, in this new world, everything,and I mean anything is possible.
</p>
 <h4 id="chap-4">Chapter Four (A Different World)</h4>
  <p>"Okay, where do I start?" She asked

"From the beginning, I want to know everything", I replied quite enthusiastically.

"Okay, I will start from scratch, just know, it could get really confusing at some point, so don't try to take in too much at once", she said

"Alright, noted", I replied.

"The origin of the word ‘Druid’ is unclear, but the most popular view is that it comes from ‘doire’, an Irish-Gaelic word for oak tree (often a symbol of knowledge), also meaning ‘wisdom’. 
Druids were concerned with the natural world and its powers, and considered trees sacred, particularly the oak." .

"There is a lot of mystery shrouding the actual history of the Druids, as our knowledge is based on limited records. Druidism is thought to have been a part of Celtic and Gaulish culture in Europe, with the first classical reference to us in the 2nd century BC. We were incredibly powerful and respected, able to banish people from the society for breaking the sacred laws, and even able to come between two opposing armies and prevent warfare! We did not have to pay taxes or serve in battle. Druid women were also considered equal to men in many respects, unusual for an ancient community. They could take part in wars and even divorce their husbands!"

"Druidic Magic is the magic used by those of us who revere nature and is practiced by the druidic orders. It is based on our belief in "essences" and the ability of the sentient mind to merge with it and then to manipulate it. Learning and performing Druidic Magic are long processes, but the results are often quite spectacular.
Only druids are known to practice the merging of essences."

"We believe that all things in this world exist on two levels; the physical level, and the spiritual level. What druids call an "essence" is the spiritual side of any given object. Essences are not visible to humans, or any other known race, but with the proper training, it is possible to interact with them. If an essence is changed somehow, its material counterpart changes to accommodate it."

"For we druids ,an essence is the spiritual make-up of its material counterpart. Essence and material counterpart form a unity, but the key to Druidic Magic is to alter the essence towards a new unity."

"According to the druidic interpretation of life, essence comes into being at the same exact time that its material counterpart comes into existence. For example, a human essence comes into being as soon as a child is conceived. However, it is rare - if not impossible - for an essence to die (theories vary here on how and when), despite whether or not its physical counterpart has died. The physical counterpart must be completely and utterly destroyed for its essence to die. Example: If a tree were to die, its essence would not die, merely change from the essence of a live tree, to the essence of a dead one. However, when a fire burns out, it is supposed to have completely gone, and thus its essence must have died. It has left its mark in the form of ashes, but it is completely dead. It is also possible for an essence to be consumed by another, such as when eaten. This could be said to destroy the "eaten" essence, but we druids believe that they just become one. An often quoted example of this is when rain droplets are absorbed by plants, the water essence disappears, consumed by the plant's essence."

"Each essence is as completely unique as is its counterpart, but like its counterpart, it shares similarities as well. All essences fit into one of the seven druidic base essences,  which are: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Plant, Animal, and Sentient Being. "

"For instance, a small rock's essence is as different from a mountain's essence as their physical manifestations are, but the essences are still Earth based. Nothing in this world has an essence that fits into two categories. It always has a dominant essence type. Sometimes this is confusing, for it seems that some objects in the world could theoretically be classified as two, but this is mainly due to confusion. For example, if one were to mix sand and water, a new essence would not be created, there would merely be two essences next to each other, water and sand, and while their physical aspects may be mixed, their essences are still quite separate."

"So you're saying the druids, have the ability to manipulate the spiritual realm", I asked, quite confused now.

"I wouldn't want you to see it as controlling the spiritual realm, it's more like manipulating it, shaping it to your own ideas", she replied.

I sighed, "now I'm confused already", I said.

"You know what , I think it's best I stop here for now, so you can have time to absorb all what you've heard, I know it's quite a lot to take in, and you probably have a lot of questions, just hold on to 
it, everything would reveal itself to you sooner or later", she said, with a concerned look on her face.

"One last question", I said
"What was the creature that attacked me?"

"The Empusa" she replied

"What is the Empusa", I asked, still confused

"The Empusa is often depicted as a beautiful woman, who transforms into a creature with sharp teeth, flaming hair, and (in some interpretations) bat wings. Empusa was said to be a demigoddess under the control of the goddess Hecate, a being that is often associated with crossroads and entrance ways."

"So why was this empusa after me?" , I asked, this time pretty scared

"That's enough for one night Chosen one, tomorrow is another day, rest, your training starts tomorrow, you need all your energy", she said as she made her way out of the room.

"By the way, you should know one thing, the druid world has been in existence for a really long time, and our ways and styles are very much confusing even to the elders, unlike humans we're not stereotyped and the presence of magic makes everything pretty complicated, making you understanding it in a few hours quite impossible, so don't bother yourself about not understanding, you will, with time.

" Good night Chosen one", she said

"My name is Richard", I said in a pretty tired tone

"Goodnight Richard", and she was gone.,

     <h4 id="chap-5">Chapter Five (Journey For Revenge)</h4>
  <p>Treasure

"The walls have been speaking, I hear whispers, they say the chosen one is found" Mike said quite sarcastically.

"Yes" I said, sounding as plain as I could.

"So? What's the deal about him, is he huge? Does his eyes spit fire, does he have the smile of the morning Star?….." Mike asked again, this time one could see the ridicule in his eyes.

"What do you care? You never were one to believe in the prophesy or any of the nonsensical beliefs as you would put it" I replied, barely hiding the anger in my voice, I just was not in the mood for his egocentric attitude today, there were more important things like how I was going to help Richard perform the ancient spell before time runs out or he looses his life, whichever comes first, not here letting one over egoistic delirious person like Mike feast on my emotions.

But no matter how hard I tried, he always seemed to manage somehow to get to me. Can't believe I was once in love with him.

Mike is not the average druid mage, unlike the rest of us that were born into the sacrificers lineage, my parents were sacrificers, likewise their parents also, and then the one before them and the list goes on.

But he was different, his parents were never sacrificers, neither were they even warriors, they were just the average druids, who got killed during the dark age, the dark age was the greatest war that was ever experienced between the six races and the longest, it lasted 7 years and 8 months, no one knew what started it, or at least no one spoke about it. Mike's parents were among the victims of this war, his whole family was slaughtered, he was still a child then, he was barely 5, according to how the story was told, his parent and several others were ambushed by elves and brutally killed,how he survived still remains a mystery to some of us. One of the elders found him and then brought him to join the sacrificers, to fight for his kingdom , but we all knew he only joined to avenge his parents death. He still had a personal grudge against the elves, he swore to make them pay.

"Magic is leaving the air, many of us gets weaker and more vulnerable as the day passes, I think this is the right time for me to start caring", he said, he had this smirk on his face now.

I couldn't help but notice his eyes, this had always been my weakness for him, he had this perfect blue eyes that sparkled when your stare at them for too long, his whole body was like that of an ancient Greek god, he was practically the type of guy any female druid would easily fall for , for even someone as tough as myself was not exempted, that was what I did, I fell, I fell so deep, but no one was there to catch me.

"I see you still stare a lot, does that mean you still have feelings for me", he said with this evil smirk on his face.
I see he was pretty having fun playing on my intelligence, there was no way I was going to give him that pleasure the second time.

"You wish", I replied, sounding as stern as possible.
"The elders want you to scout the kingdom, find out how much damage the waning magic is doing" I said, as I made my way to open the door.

"Are you not meant to scout with me" , he asked

"No, I can't, I have training with the chosen one tomorrow, I need all my energy" I said, as I walked into my room.

"But , I still think you can still spare a little time" He said, trying to sound charming.

"If you take one more step towards me, you'll be lucky if you still have a hand", I threatened, as I noticed him trying to step into my room.

He must have noticed the look on my face as he retreated back out the door, with this look of both fear and pride in his eyes.
I slammed the door feeling pleased with myself.

     <h4 id="chap-6">Chapter Six (Glimpse of the Future)</h4>
  <p>The riders were getting close now, they advanced closer with each minute that passed , looking more fierce with each step, the stone was just behind that wall, feels so close now than ever, we just had to figure a way into the building before the riders got to us.
They were trained elves, highly skilled, probably treasure might be able to match their speed and skill , but I was a different case, they would just slice through me without even batting an eye.

I just had to figure out this final puzzle and then the door would be opened, I racked my head for various answers, nothing was coming, the puzzle was beyond anything I had ever seen, and magic was not effective here.

The riders now stood in front of us, four in number , each on a rather fierce looking horse, they each had a spear, and as they came down from the horse, I knew there and then I was going to die. 
Treasure lunged at the first one and quickly he was down, her sword protruding out his chest, the second charged at her but she quickly deflected his spear with her sword, and then swung her sword at his face, I had never seen her look so fierce. The third now came from behind, the was no way she was going to see him coming, I had to do something, I screamed, "look out!!!!", but I was too late as he plunged his spear straight into her heart, she went still, I screamed……..

"Hey Richard wake up", her voice pierced into my sleep.
I opened my eyes slowly, as I tried to take in where I was, treasure stood right by the bed, she had this worry face on.

"What's wrong", I asked, as I managed to sit up on the bed, so it was all a dream, yet if felt so real, like I literally watched her die.

"Your eyes were white, like totally white", she said , looking very concerned.

I sighed, "it was only a bad dream" I said.

"Okay, please get dressed, you're late for your training", she said as she walked out the room.
"And Richard, make sure you eat , you'll need all your energy, and luck also, you'll need plenty of that", she said as she walked away.

What did she mean by luck?, These people were just too dramatic for me, I sighed, as I made my way to the bathroom, why couldn't I just have a normal life….


It was until I had finished dressing up, before it dawned on me that I never asked treasure where the training ground was, she only said to meet her for training, like I knew everywhere in the building, and I was still shaken from the dream to think clearly. 
Guess I would just try to find my way myself, probably wander around the castle until I find someone nice enough to show me the way.

Then I heard a knock on the door,
"Chosen one, are you ready now?, I have been asked to escort you to the arena of the fallen Kings for your training", Arla said,
guess Treasure is really as smart as I thought, she couldn't have left me to find my way alone, I smiled as I opened the door to greet Arla.

"Good morning chosen one", she said as she bowed.

"Good morning Arla, and you don't have to be so formal, I am no chosen one, no need for all the formalities, moreover, there's just both of us here", I replied.

"I'm sorry chosen one, but I cannot disobey the elders, please don't make me have to" she replied.

"Okay, suit yourself" I said, as we made our way out the room.

This was the first time I was stepping out my room, since I found myself in this strange place, the corridors were quite spacious and they seem to go on forever, we passed other doors as we continued walking, I imagined they were rooms of properly the mages or something.

We took another turn now , as we headed down a stairway, I was beginning to feel like we had been walking for hours, how big could this castle be, I wondered in my head.

"It's actually the biggest castle in the whole of the druid kingdom, it was built by Lord Figor the first, ever since he became the first king of the druids , and since then it's been home to various druid Kings , before eventually being a seat of power for the elders and also a refuge for the sacrificers and mages , it has 24 rooms, other than some other sacred rooms like the Chamber of Secrets, where the elders discussed important matters" , Arla replied again to my thoughts, I had forgotten she was the mind reader.

"So who comes up with all these cool names, chamber of secrets, Arena of fallen Kings, etc…, or do you guys like just come up with it in your heads", I asked quite sarcastically, trying to lighten the mood.

"These names are as old as the building itself, and each of these names were given by Lord Figor himself, they are sacred names and should be regarded as such", she said barely batting an eye.

"How old are you ?"  I asked , guessing in my head I would assume she would be probably 15 or 16, she still looked so young and her eyes still seemed pretty innocent.

"I'll be 124 next moon", she replied, still without any expression on her face.

"What!!!!!, Do you mean like one hundred and twenty four", I asked without trying to hide the shock in my voice.

"Yes, the druids don't age like normal people do, though we're not immortals, but we do live for a very long time, we're protected by this cocoon of energy that slows down our metabolism, thereby making ageing slower than normal and also given us enhanced strength and speed" she replied.

"Ohhh, that explains why treasure seems so fast and strong for a human, not to talk of a lady", I said. Still feeling very shocked.

"So how old is Treasure?" I asked out of curiosity.

Arla smiled, 
"Why don't you ask her yourself". She said as we stepped out the castle.
</p>
     <h4 id="chap-7">Chapter Seven (Arena of Kings)</h4>
  <p>The arena of the fallen whatever was typically not what I expected it to be, from the name I was expecting to see some sort of enchanted garden with lots of ancient objects and mythical items . But I was rather disappointed, it was just literally an open field, with some ugly statues and  medieval weapons.

"So what makes this place special? Because I don't see anything that makes it look like arena of fallen Kings, looks more like desert of boredom", I said quite sarcastically as I made my way towards treasure, making quite sure she heard me.

"This is the birth place of druid magic, this was where Lord figor first had his training and learnt how to control and manipulate magic", treasure replied as she walked towards me.

"Whatever, please can I know why I'm here though?", I said feeling rather uninterested in the druid nonsense.

This whole thing was already getting pretty annoying, almost getting me killed was one thing, now keeping me here against my will is another thing.

"You have to train", she replied

"To get to the ruins of Memphis and get the bloodstone, would require you to master your powers, as it won't be an easy journey, already the chances of your survival are pretty slim"

"Thanks for the vote of confidence", I replied.

"Apparently, the elders need you to prove that you're indeed the chosen one, so you will need to perform the most ancient of all spells, the spell of the wailing monkeys" she said.

"And who says I will like to prove anything, I never even wanted to be the chosen one in the first place, you took me by force, shoved an unknown title on me, and now you want me to prove I am what I don't even know about , how awkward could this place get?" I replied, getting really displeased.

"Doesn't matter, you're here now, and you have to perform the spell" she said, I could feel her anger rise

"And what if I don't?", I asked

"Well, it depends, do you want to live?", She replied, with a very cold stare

Did she really just threaten me?, Or what does she mean by if I want to live?, something doesn't add up here!

"Hey , what do you mean by if I want to live?", I asked as I made my way towards her

"I'm done talking, Mike will be taking you through the training, will see you after", she said as she walked away

"Don't take her so seriously, she can be pretty hard sometimes, just give her time she'll come around"
Arla said from behind me

I turned to face her little face staring at me, this girl really needs to stop acting like a ghost, how does she even do that, always appearing at the right time.

"She's only very frustrated with the situation on ground, the blood stone must be found and soon," Arla said

"What's the deal about him, the Mike guy" I asked quite inquisitively

"Treasure's ex lover, no one knows what happened between them, but things have been pretty cold between them, he's majorly just trouble , you should avoid him as much as you can", she replied

"Well, we shall see..", I said quite wearily.

                              .............

The whole place went still, and it was like time froze, the floor started to shake vehemently, even the walls were vibrating loudly,

My eyes were fixed on the huge rock in front of me, it was vibrating also, I just needed to concentrate long enough to move it, it shouldn't be that difficult, I just need to focus , focus Richard , focus, you just need to...

"If you continue at this pace, you would never be ready enough to get the bloodstone" Mike said as he interrupted me

"Well If you really are that good , then why don't you get the stone yourself" I replied quite rudely.

I was already getting frustrated, it's been almost six hours now, and I'm still stuck trying to move this dumb piece of rock, I'm beginning to think this whole chosen one thing is just a big waste of time.

"The elders have insisted that the chosen one has to be the one to lead the expedition to Memphis. Otherwise, left to me you would be somewhere rotting to die now", Mike replied obviously angry now

"Well, guess I should be glad it's not up to you, 
you know what?, I'm sick of this whole thing, chosen one , bloodstone, druids, I'm sick of everything"

"And you know what Mike, you're not as tough as you think you are, I think you're just scared of everything, you're scared treasure doesn't love you anymore, you're jealous she might begin to like me, you're only trying to take it out on me, and I'll be gone before I let that happen", I said as I stomped off back towards the castle.

I was really done with this druid nonsense, I said to myself as I made my way back into the castle, now if only I can figure out  my way to treasure's room, I need to get out of this place as fast as possible before I start to loose my sanity.

The walls still looked as confusing as ever, I was so carried away the other time with Arla that I didn't pay attention to the turns she took, now the castle just looks like an unending game of maze.

I pushed my way forward as I kept walking, I know sooner or later I'll bump into someone. I had barely walked for 5 minutes when I noticed the huge door down the hall, it must be the famous chamber of secrets , cool, I could ask any of the elders for directions.

I increased my pace towards the door, but as I got closer, their conversation started to get my attention, I leaned closer to hear them clearly. I could barely hear what they were saying but the word chosen one kept coming up. Treasure was in the room also, I could hear her feminine voice above the rest of the coarse elderly voices, she was saying something about giving someone a chance , I guess that was me. I adjusted my ears lightly on the door, as I leaned more closer, now I could make out what they were saying.

"He's probably just still recovering from the shock of all these, he needs more time, he'll be ready soon", treasure said , I could feel the worry in her voice

"He's never going to be ready enough to get the stone in time" one of the elders said

"There's nothing else we can do, he's our only choice right now" treasure said

"There is one last option, but it was forbidden by Lord figor a long time ago" one of the elders replied

"What option?" Treasure asked, quite curious

"It was believed that, if things should ever get so bad that magic was ever threatened, and the bloodstone needed to be recovered fast, the blood of the chosen one could be used to unlock the ....."one of the elders spoke, but I could barely hear whatever it is he said next,

My head almost exploded, did they just say blood!!!

So that's what treasure meant by "if I want to live," they are really planning to kill me. I felt so betrayed and lost as I turned around and headed for the door, it was time for me to make my escape.....
</p>
     <h4 id="chap-8">Chapter Eight (Who is the Fair Skinned)</h4>
  <p>It was like the walls suddenly had eyes and were watching me, various voices echoed in my head and it was like my tummy was literally upside down, my knees hurt from the bruises obtained from scratching them against the trees, my legs started to hurt really bad, but I couldn't afford to stop now, I needed to be as far away before they found out I was gone.

I can't believe I trusted them, they wanted my blood all along. So much for only the chosen one can save the stone. And treasure; she took advantage of me, I felt like a part of me had been ripped off.

My legs finally gave in, as I gave up to sit on a stump, I used that moment to access where I was, I had been blinded with the desire to run that I had not even bothered about where I was going, now as I took a long look at the trees around me , I knew there and then that I was lost.

The sun was beginning to set now, and I envisioned it would be dark in a matter of minutes, I need to find a place to pass the night,I'd been walking and running for almost 2 hours,i'd seen alot of movies where they make camp fires and some other stuffs, it shouldn't be that difficult I guess.

Maybe I should have just stayed at the castle, there must have been a mistake somewhere , maybe they didn't really want to kill me, or maybe I heard the wrong thing. Sighs, this whole thing is driving me crazy already, I just want to go home.

The first wave of fear hit me as i heard a snap in the bush behind me, I suddenly had this feeling like something was watching me, I rushed to my feet, my heart started beating so hard, I heard another sound behind me, turning around to see, I saw the same blue eyes that once tried to kill me, i would remember those eyes anywhere, eyes that pierced into my soul, it was the Chimera, I ran.....

The creature made a growling sound as it ran after me, I could hear it's snarling behind me, I just kept running, I could feel it close to me now, I looked back to see how close it was, but it was too late as I hit my head on a branch and fell, then everything went black.......

...............

"Hey , wake up", a voice said
, I could barely make out the person,but It sounded like a female.

My head hurt so bad , I tried opening my eyes but everything was so blurry , my knees were also hurting and my back felt like I'd been pushed off a cliff.

I tried opening my eyes again and this time I could see A little bit, I could make out the form of a lady, at first I thought it was treasure but then this lady was fairer, almost white skinned, her eyes had this blue color but the most distinguishing feature were her ears, it seemed so pointed and long, like the movies I had seen about elves, but elves couldn't be real , ,they were just fictional characters coined up by someone I guess.
But then who was I to call anything fictional, some minutes ago I was almost killed by a fictional creature, at this point in my life, anything is possible.

It was then the memory of what happened before I blacked out dawned on me, how I was almost sure the Chimera was going to kill me, then hitting my head

"Who are you? Where am i", I asked feeling very defensive and scared

"You're clearly not a druid, but still doesn't explain why you have druid clothes on", she said, clearly ignoring my question

"So tell me , what are you doing wandering about in the elven woods?", She asked, sounding very Stern and threatening

"So you're really an elf, how is that possible", I said, clearly showing the amazement in my voice

"Will you just answer my damn question, are you a spy?, Did the druids send you?, How many of you are here?", She asked this time I could sense the mean in her voice

"My name is Richard, I was kidnapped by the druids some days ago, I tried to escape and then I found myself lost in the forest and being pursued by a Chimera, that's about the summary", I replied, deliberately holding back some important informations

I couldn't afford to tell this stranger about the bloodstone or about me being the chosen one, or about magic disappearing, I just don't know who to trust at this point

"It doesn't make sense, why would the druids go through the stress of kidnapping a human" she asked clearly not buying my story

"Been asking myself the same question also", I replied, trying to act as convincing as I could.

"So you expect me to believe that you escaped the druid castle only to get lost in the forest" she said

"Yes, I guess" I said

"Hmm, well better hope your story is as convincing when we get to the chief"she said as she stood up

"Wait, what chief" I asked obviously very confused

"Don't worry , you'll find out when you you wake" she said

"Wake!!, But I'm not sleeping.....

Before I could complete my statement, I felt a sharp pain in my head, then everything went black
</p>
     <h4 id="chap-9">Chapter Nine (Sister's of Dale)</h4>
  <p>Treasure

"What do you mean you can't find him", I asked without hiding the anger in my voice

"We had a disagreement, then he left, I thought I saw him head for the castle, but now Arla says he's not in his room" Mike replied

"You had one job Mike, and now you've ruined that also, what if he's lost somewhere or probably dead" I said clearly very angry now

I can't believe I actually put Mike in charge of training Richard , like what was I thinking?, I can't help but blame myself for all these, the elders are slowly loosing their magic, and if the bloodstone is not found soon, magic would be gone forever, the elders would not be able to sustain the ageing spell anymore and soon enough they would cease to exist and the whole of the druid kingdom would be in chaos without a leader nor magic, the other factions would wage war against us and all will be lost.

"Get as much sacrificers as you can and get them to  search the forest, I need him found as soon as possible, and you come with me, we have to get somewhere", I said, as I made my way towards Richard's room, I grabbed his shirt lying on the bed and left the castle as fast as I could.

"Where ?" Mike asked quite curiously

"We are going to Dale" I replied

There was only one way around this, we had to find the sisters of Dale, they are the only ones that possessed the ability to perform a location spell.

The sisters of Dale were ancient druids, very proficient in the use of magic and spells, they aided Lord Figor in ending the war between the factions a long time ago,  it was rumoured that shortly after Lord Figor's reign, they started practicing dark sorcery and were thereafter banished by the elders to forever be confined to the temple of Dale, and thus earned the name, sisters of Dale.
                      
                       ………….

I could see the temple now as we got closer, it looked quite smaller than the last time I was here.

"Wait outside for me, I have to take care of this myself" I said as I walked towards the door.

I knocked the door twice just as I remembered, and then it swung open leading to a bigger room, I stepped in.

Normally one would feel the presence of magic even  from the door, but now I could barely find a trace of magic in the air, the sisters must have noticed the vanishing of magic also.

"Why have you come?", A voice said from the shadows

"I need to find someone", I replied

"You mean the chosen one", another voice said, but still sounding like the first

"Yes, I need to know if he is still alive", I said, already angry that they refused to show their faces

"We cannot help you", the first one replied

"I need to find him soon , you siste's are the only ones that can perform a location spell", I said sounding quite worried

"The magic leaves, we save our magic for us only" another voice replied

"If I don't find him ,all will be lost and the druids would have lost the war even before it begins" I replied

"Then so be it, the druids will finally get a payback for what they did to us", another of the sisters answered

"You know good and well they did what was necessary, you were practicing dark magic, the future of the druids were at stake, they had to stop you one way or another"I replied, very angry at this point.

"Lies!!, We were never a threat, we only wanted to make us stronger, to be very powerful,then the other factions can then fear us, we were never evil!!" Another one of them replied, I had succeeded in upsetting them already

"Prove it, prove your innocence, help me find him" I said

The magical aura came back as they stepped out of the shadows, guess my words must have hit them, they still looked as young as I remember, they must have been casting very powerful ageing spells, guess that explains why I couldn't feel magic when I entered the room, they must be consuming a lot of it.

The strangest thing about the sisters of the Dale was that they all had the same face, more like they were one and yet different at the same time.

"Maybe, we might be able to help, but it comes at a price", the one in the middle spoke

"Name your price" I replied already conscious of time wasted

"The price can't be named now , you will know when the time comes" they chorused

"So be it," I replied

"Just perform the spell"

"Do you have something of his" they asked

"Yes " I said , as I handed them Richard's shirt I had previously taken from his bed

One of them waved her hand , and then a fire ignited in the middle of the room, she then dropped the shirt into the fire, as they all joined their hands together and started making some chants, the fire got more fierce with each word they said and it was almost like the room was going to burn , then suddenly the fire went out, and everywhere was calm again.

"He is at the elven forest, he has been captured by the elves" they all said together

Elves!! What? Our greatest enemy, they've been sworn enemies of the druids ever since the battle of factions during the reign of Lord Figor. How come they have Richard, I just hope they haven't killed him.

"Is he alive?" I asked barely hiding the worry look on my face

"Yes, for now" one of them said as they all started laughing and then slowly retreated into the shadows, then the whole room went very quiet like no one had ever been there before

"What weirdos" I sighed as I made my way out the door, at least now I know where Richard is

"Did you find him" Mike asked as I walked up to him

"He has been captured by the elves" I replied

"Oh! Oh!, Now That's bad" Mike said , I could almost hear worry in his voice

"Should I prepare the army" he asked

"No, don't do that, once the elves see us equip our forces, they would do the same to theirs also, and we do not want to start another war between factions, casualties as usually much, we can't risk that. Or they could just kill Richard . We need to offer them a truce" I replied

"So what do we do ?" Mike asked

"We go alone" I replied

"Where do we know he is?" mike said, quite unconvinced of my plan

"There's only one clan of elves that lives that close, the wood elves.."

"We're going to the isle of balar.."
</p>
     <h4 id="chap-10">Chapter Ten (Isle of Balar)</h4>
  <p>Oberon

The woods no longer looked as homely as It first was, the leaves now more faded with a lot of its fallen comrades lying on the forest floor. I shook my head as I stared at my wrinkled hands, this was never supposed to be, elves are magical creatures meant to remain youthful for the rest of their lives, bounded by magic, we were protected by cocoon of energy which kept us young and agile, but then as I run my fingers through my disfigured face I knew there and then something had to be done about this unprecedented phenomena.

"Summon the dryad at once" I said to the guard , 
"Her sleep is long over due"

"Yes Chief", the guard replied as he bowed before making his way out.

An explanation had to be given on the sudden loss of magic, never in my reign as chief of the wood elves for the past millennium has anything of such ever happened, and the only type of elf that has been around long enough to give a clue are the dryads.
The dryads are ancient female spirits of the natural world, minor goddesses of the forests, rivers, springs, meadows, mountains and seas. They are responsible for the crafting of nature's wild beauty, from the arrangement and growth of the plants, flowers and trees, to the nurture of wild birds and animals, and the formation of rocky caverns, springs, wetlands, and brooks and overall they are believed to ensure the balance of the elements. Only a Royal blood could summon a dryad, as they were the only ones with authority to do so without destructive consequences.

The wood elves has been in existence as direct descendants of illuvatar, the first elven race, Calm, serene, and difficult to surprise. They are at one with the world of nature, using what naturally occurs in the world to shelter or defend themselves, and thus are uncomfortable in cities. They have lost the urge to build and replace nature with walls and palaces. Even the cities built by their elven kin seem foolish to the wood elves, who have come to believe that buildings of stone are transitory in nature, and that in time, the forest returns to overgrow the greatest of cities.
After the battle of the 5 races, the elves were divided into various clans, and each clans went to domicile in separate parts of the world.

The high elves are the conservative warrior-aristocracy society with a greater understanding of magic that they use to enhance their everyday lives.
They can be seen as emotional creatures, perceived by some as empathetic, as well as passionate about things they take liking to. They are the proud ones and see themselves better than the other elven race.

The Touel'alfar are the winged elves, although they are flightless, but they possess wings which they use to hover and glide, giving them exceptional balance. They were once a prominent race, but over the years their numbers have declined due to the war against the Demon Dactyl. Nowadays, they train humans to become rangers for two purposes: to give elves access to the outside world without leaving their valley, and to correct evils in the world.

The moon elves tend to be more impulsive than the other elves, and dislike remaining in one place for any length of time. They are happiest when traveling, especially across the expanses of untrodden wilderness. They are drawn to adventure through sheer wanderlust, desiring to see and do everything possible during their long lives.

The aquatic elves closely resemble their land-dwelling kin, but have developed gills for breathing underwater, and webbed fingers and toes for swimming. They have an over-developed sense of self-worth, viewing their land-bound cousins as limited by their environment, boasting they have embraced a biome filled with life and endless possibilities.

The sun elves are the most arrogant, haughty, and usually believe they are the true elven race, the builders and leaders of the elven realms. They feel the other elves fail to live up to the solemnity and dignity of their ancient stock.

The most dangerous of the elven races are the dark elves, they are sadistic, destructive, and treacherous, viewing themselves as the rightful heirs to world and still remember the perceived injustice of their exile to the underworld. They hate other races and either wish to make war upon them or view those others with contempt and tolerate them only as necessary for trade or temporary military alliances. They are usually full of mischiefs and should never be trussaid
...

"Jafar is back from the hunt chief, he demands to see you , something to do with a human lurking in the elven forest", the guard said as he walked towards me

" bring him" I replied, quite curiously, what could a human be doing so far from home, the closest human village is about 10,000 kilometers away

"Greetings, my chief" jafar bowed as he reached my presence as was the custom ,slung on his shoulder was the lifeless body of the human

"We found him lurking around the forest on the border of the isle, and judging by his clothes, I'll say he's a druid spy, but seeing as he is human, I am more baffled my chief, I can't possibly imagine what the druids would want with a human" jafar said further

"Did he speak his name?" I asked

"Yes chief, he says he is called Richard" jafar replied

"Tie him up and take him to the prisoners tent , he will speak when he awakens" I said

"In the meantime, double the guards and send out scouts, there could be more of him"

"Yes chief" jafar replied as he carried the body away. He had always been our strongest warrior and smart too.

"The dryad has been summoned, she stands awaiting your command, chief" the guard I had sent earlier to summon the dryad replied as he approached me

"Send her in at once".....
